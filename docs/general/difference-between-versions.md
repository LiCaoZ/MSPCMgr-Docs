# Differences between versions

Microsoft PC Manager has two branches: **China** and **Global**. The *China* branch has a faster release cycle and more localized features, but may not be suitable for privacy laws in other regions (eg: GDPR). Instead, the *Global* branch has better compliance with local laws, at the cost of longer release cycles (due to strict compliance) and fewer new features.

But rest assured: both versions are *SAFE* and both comply with the promises in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).
